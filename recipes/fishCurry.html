        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are many different varieties of Indonesian curry. Each is special and unique!!!.
        One of those varieties is called "Gulai or Gule".
        This dish is very popular in most part of Java and West Sumatra region.</p>
        <p>Personally I would say "Gulai" is considered to be a ligt or a mild curry,
        compared to it's heavy sort of currys which usually contain some distinctive curry spices such as : cinnamon, clove, cumin and cardamom. However it doesn't mean that this recipe lack of curry's taste and flavour.
        In contrary if you are a kind of Curry's fans but do not like a strong aromatic smell of the above mentioned spices, then I will recommend you to try this once.
        If you don't like fish, there is also another variant of Javanese Gulai/light curry dish made from goat/lamb, called Gule Kambing.</p>
