            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> Here are many varieties of Indonesian poultry dishes. 
                A famous variant among them is "Singgang Ayam" or "Grilled Chicken".
                His is one of my favorite recipes – A special New Year's Eve Dinner menu for the whole family & close friends. 
            </p>

                Tips: If possible, choose the young chicken for the better taste.
                There are two ways of cutting method, concerning the serving's appearance.
                If you want to have a whole chicken to be served, then cut chicken in half lengthwise along backbone, leave the breast uncut.
                Tie up the chicken together with kitchen string. This way you will get a lovely roasted chicken at the end (see picture).
                If appearance is not your concern, then just cut the chicken in half lengthway on both sides.
                The advantage of this method : The chicken is much easier to be handled & no need extra attention.
                Whatever methods should you prefer, the taste should not be different. Good luck!!
